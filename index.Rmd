I'm using this page as a placeholder for a shiny app I'm planning - come back soon!


[First attempt!](experiment.R)

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
